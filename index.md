## Welcome!

Hey, I’m Edwine Tendong, a PhD Candidate in Condensed Matter Physics and Material Sciences at S N Bose National Centre for basic Sciences, Kolkata, India 

### Research Interests

I am primarily interested in soft matter systems. In particular, we are studying the behaviour of fluids in nano-size confinements using the techniques of equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. I am also exploring colloids and polymer grafted namoparticles. My recent interests are in using Machine learning techniques in soft matter systems.
